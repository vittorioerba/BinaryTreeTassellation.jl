# BinaryTreeTassellation


## Motivation

I wrote this code for the following reasons:
1) to try to implement a custom type in Julia for the first time. I basically implemented a binary tree structure with some additional components;
2) to try to package my code properly into a Julia package;
2) to start delving into the beautiful world of generative art. See [r/generative](https://reddit.com/r/generative).
